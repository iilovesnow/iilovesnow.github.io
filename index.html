    <p id="para"> Hello, I'm Meagan. This webpage is designed in acoordance to class CSC 106. I'm using html coding in order to produce this webpage. <br>
      I currently have three buttons above. The "About Me" button will tell you more about who I am and some of my interests. <br>
      The "javascripts" will have different code that I have embedded into this webpage and some coding projects I have completed or am working on. <br>
      And last but not least, the "Home" button, which will, surprisingly, bring you back to this page! :)
